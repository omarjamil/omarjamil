### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am the Engineering Lead at the Institute of Computing for Climate Science at University of Cambridge. My main interests are in machine learning applications in physical modelling and simulation. Previously, I haved served as a technical lead and a manager in both industry and academia where some of my projects included Parallel-in-Time algorithms([APinTA](https://github.com/UniExeterRSE/APinTA)), [RSE training programme](https://excalibur.ac.uk/projects/rse-training-algorithms/) for Exascale computing (PI on one of the grants), AI agents in defence applications, and machine learning applications for physics emulation.
